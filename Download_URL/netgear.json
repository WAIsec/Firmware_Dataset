However, enabling the mode will be prone to CVE-2011-3389., Fixed the issue where the EAP packet with unicast destination address is blocked when \u201cEAPOL Flooding mode\u201d is enabled while \u201c802.1X admin mode\u201d is disabled., Fixed the issue where the system freezes when downloading HTTPS/SSL certificate file (server.pem) to the switch., Fixed\u00a0the issue\u00a0where the\u00a0flash logs disappear after system reboot., Removed \u201cRefresh\u201d button from FLASH log page., Fixed the issue where the following optional TLV values of LLDP-MED are incorrect:, , , , , , , Fixed the\u00a0port security issue with static MAC.\u00a0\u00a0When a static MAC address is specified and the \u201cMax Allowed Dynamically Learned MAC\u201d is set to 0 for a port, this MAC address can still be learned by other ports.\u00a0\u00a0As a result, device with this MAC can work with other ports with \u201cMax Allowed Dynamically Learned MAC\u201d not set to 0, but not with the port with static MAC configured., Port PVID (Switching > VLAN > Advanced > Port PVID Configuration) does not automatically changed back to 1 after its associated VLAN is deleted., , :\u00a0\u00a0Manually change the PVID back to 1., Combined MAC and IP ACL do not work with double VLAN tagged traffic., , Using the Download Link below, download and extract the new firmware to a convenient place such as your desktop.
